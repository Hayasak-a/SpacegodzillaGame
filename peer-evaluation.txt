What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
This game is similar to the game Tetris, i learned that i can put some animation in the end scene, now i know how people made Tetris.

You need to prevent the box to go over the screen, by doing that the player need to form a line that fill with boxes. Then it can eliminate that line
