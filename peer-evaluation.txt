What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
I did not know that you can make the game screen that small!
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
The tetris blocks contained the COVID-19 symbol. 
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I love that they had the instructions on the main menu instead of having the instructions just in the about me. I would definitely include this on my games main menu.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
I think that they should just fix the bugs of the blocks falling. I've played this game multiple times and each game I only get one set of random blocks.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Nope, nothing was confusing!
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes, it's clear.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes, it does. 
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I don't think they have to add anything in thr README. I believe this because they listed the game instructions on the main menu of the game as well. 
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
This game is such a good idea! And I also love the choice of font that is used in the main menu, this gives this game a lot of juiciness.
