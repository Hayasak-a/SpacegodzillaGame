What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 I learned that you can implement more features such as a pause option within the game.


In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 I'm honestly not certain how it reflects the coronavirus...


What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 I would like to apply an instruction screen. I thought that was pretty cool. 


What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
There are some bugs that need to be fixed. If you press space, the game crashes, at least for me. I think the floor needs to be fixed where the blocks will not fall below the screen as well.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I thought the script was laid out very well.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes, they noted in the read me that each member contributed their parts.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes. I like "SpaceGodzillaGroup".

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 I think the README.md was very descriptive.


Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

There are minor bugs, but the coding and design of the game are good. 

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?

3.5/5
