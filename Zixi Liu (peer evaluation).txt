What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
The blocks are the "virus" and the goal in this type of game is to eliminate as many blocks as possible.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
The UI is old-fashioned, it does remind me of that classic tetris.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Maybe try to improve the coding, the first block of virus passes straight through the screen and the other blocks never came.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I'm confused about the "connection" with a green sign next to some lines of the script.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
The README is very thorough.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
The group is trying to express many ideas in such a simple game and I loved it. Toilet papers, germs, and face masks... it's fun.


How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
